## Background
Background Summer 2020 saw the rise of support for #BlackLivesMatter and social justice movements after the murder of George Floyd. While in-person protests supporting the #BLM movement were held during the coronavirus epidemic in every major US city, social media sites — including Twitter — were also awash with opinions about the movement. When Twitter users read tweets about the #BLM movement, and the contemporaneous #BlueLivesMatter movement in support of policing efforts, they might be interested in categorizing tweets based on their attitudes toward the #BLM and #BlueLivesMatter movements.
